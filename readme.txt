Activity Feed Anywhere adds a custom BuddyPress activity post box and/or feed on any page.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you add a fully functional BuddyPress activity stream to any page. Designed to match the native BuddyPress activity feed, you can now post and see activity from wherever you like.

== How to use Activity Feed Anywhere ==

Simply add the shortcode \[activity_feed_anywhere\] to any page on your site.

If you would rather not display the feed, but only the 'post box', simply use \[activity_feed_anywhere feed=false \]. Activity entered here will show up in activity feeds elsewhere in the site.

If you would rather not display the post box, but only the feed itself, simply use \[activity_feed_anywhere postbox=false \].
